Text to speech example in Ruby

If you have ever wanted to try text to speech this is a very basic example.
If you are using *Windows*, uncomment the gem in the gemfile, if using *linux* make sure espeak is installed. I have not tried it on *mac* but it should work. If not please let me know what you did to make it work. 

:hammer: I have tested this with Ruby 3.01 and it works fine.

HAVE FUN!
