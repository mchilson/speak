# speak
Text to speech example in Ruby

If you have ever wated to try test to speech this is a very basic example based on code from rosett code.
If you are using Windows, uncomment the gem in teh gemfile, if using linux make sure espeak is installed. have not tried it on mac but it should work. If not please let me know what you did to make it work. 

I have tested this with Ruby 2.x and it works fine.

HAVE FUN!
